    This is a project done by me for the college subject "Networks and Operative Systems",
    given by Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC).

    This project has consisted about using Debian OS to create
    a software based on some exercises by using tools like Postgres, Bun web, Docker, and configure HTTP and HTTPs proxies.

    <p>
        It is possible to access to the exercise given by clicking on this link (it is in Spanish):

    </p>
        <exercise_1>
            <h2>
                <b>
                    <u>
                        1. VM creation and Debian OS installation
                    </u>
                </b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                On this first exercise we installed the requested Debian OS ISO on a VM (Virtual Machine), which was VirtualBox,
                as I have experience with this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nmap and curl tools were downloaded after setting the OS into the VM, as well as Docker engine and Git.
            </p>
            <p>
                After setting up all things needed for the project, command "ping" was executed to check connection between
                VM as Guest and main computer as Host. Later, by using command "add_user"
            </p>
