    </b>
</h2>

<p>
    I´m a Computer Engineering at UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) and a passionate about techs and science.
    I´ve always been motivated by helping people, and we´re living a tech revolution that can help and improve
    lives in very different ways, so this is the way to use science and tech to help people.

    </h2>
<p>
    To work properly is needed to have not just the knowledge and skills to do the job, but also a comfortable
    setup to do so.
    <p>
        In my case, I work with Kali Linux, a OS from Linux oriented specifically to Cybersecurity.
        It contains on its base installation lots of scan, analyisis and exploit tools, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Nmap:
                </b> 
                    Ports and networks maping tool.
            <li>
                <b>
                    Metasploit:
                </b> 
                    Exploits execution framework.
            <li>
                <b>
                    Wireshark:
                </b> 
                    Network protocols analyzer.
            <li>
                <b>
                    John the Ripper:
                </b> 
                    Password cracker.
            <li>
                <b>
                    Aircrack-ng:
                </b> 
                    Audit tool for wireless networks
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        With these tools I do my Cybersecurity tasks, such as protecting my networks and devices or scanning
        vulnerabilities on websites or systems (always under permission or in controlled environment).

            My experience has consisted about:

    </b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cybersecurity Hackathon promoted by Onklub, which consisted about working as a team with different
            roles each one aiming to create an idea or project to help systems and persons against phishing.
            (2nd place on 2024)
        </li>
        <li>
            Creation of a software on a VM (Virtual Machine) using Debian OS that connects a web from an API and create a DDBB with
            Postgres from the start. This software also listens from different ports and connects with host machine and has a HTTPS connection by a Proxy.
            I have a repository that contains further explainations and the steps to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working on simulated projects on HackTheBox learning the basics and advanced tools and workflows.

        On this repository you can find different projects I´ve been doing recently. Hope they´re useful and I´m always open to listen tips and better ways to do´em.
