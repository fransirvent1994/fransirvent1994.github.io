        <p>
            I´m a Computer Engineering at UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) and a passionate about techs and science.
            I´ve always been motivated by helping people, and we´re living a tech revolution that can help and improve
            lives in very different ways, so this is the way to use science and tech to help people.

            To work properly is needed to have not just the knowledge and skills to do the job, but also a comfortable
            setup to do so.
            <p>
                In my case, I work with Kali Linux, a OS from Linux oriented specifically to Cybersecurity.
                It contains on its base installation lots of scan, analyisis and exploit tools, such as:

                With these tools I do my Cybersecurity tasks, such as protecting my networks and devices or scanning
                vulnerabilities on websites or systems (always under permission or in controlled environment).

                    Zero, which is a pentesting device that emulates
                    a large variety of functions, like RFID, NFC, SubGhz,
                    and are capable to work with boards like ESP32, enabling
                    to pentest into networks, bluetooths, radios, etc.
