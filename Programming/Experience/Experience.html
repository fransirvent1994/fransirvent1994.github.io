    <p>
        I´m a Computer Engineering at UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) and a passionate about techs and science.
        I´ve always been motivated by helping people, and we´re living a tech revolution that can help and improve
        lives in very different ways, so this is the way to use science and tech to help people.

    <p>
        I´ve been working with different programming languages since some years ago, and started with C because of
        college subjects, which became a very hard but helpfull way to get into. As I was getting better on it, started to
        get into another kind of programming languages, such as front-ends (HTML, CSS, React) and finally came up with Python after
        trying with JavaScript, Java and C++ and C#, but Python has become my favorite programming language, so I work mostly with it
        in despite I´m not afraid to try with another one for any kind of project or work.
        <p>
            Now I can say I´ve learnt enough to help myself and other people with my own ideas and imagination.
